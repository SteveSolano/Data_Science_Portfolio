## Project Details

### Project 1: E-commerce Data Analysis

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of e-commerce data to understand customer behavior and enhance marketing strategy. I used Python and libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to explore the data and present meaningful visualizations.

### Project 2: Housing Price Prediction

In this project, I implemented machine learning models to predict housing prices based on various features. I utilized regression techniques and model evaluation to achieve accurate predictions and presented the results through interactive visualizations.

### Other Projects

In addition to the projects mentioned above, I've worked on a variety of other projects spanning areas like natural language processing, financial analysis, and more. You can explore them [here](other-projects).
